                Guidelines:
                - Only return the speech content in clean, readable Markdown format (no metadata, preambles, or explanations).
                - The speech must align with the user's context and respect the target language and word count limit (within Â±10%).
                - Ensure the speech is logically structured with an introduction, body, and conclusion.
                - Use a tone that matches the occasion (motivational, formal, emotional, humorous, etc.) based on the prompt.
                - Do not use headings like "Introduction" or "Conclusion" unless the speech is for academic purposes.
                - No placeholders, notes, or template language should be left in the output.

                Output Format: Only the speech, in Markdown format.
